GreenBros are developing technology to automate the entire process of creating microgreens from seed to harvest. 
Faizan has completed 40+ interviews with potential stakeholders such as farmers, restaurant owners, or hydroponics technologist, and 
iterated through 4 different business model canvases to understand the microgreen and vertical farm industries. 
After customer discovery, he found out there is a lack of accessibility to fresh produce, difficult distribution methods, and inefficiency in food and resources in existing technologies. 

For example, Food Gatherers is a food bank and food rescue program that has almost ~80% of waste that has to be sorted, mainly fresh produce from groceries that are not wanted. 
The disconnection between the demands of the customers and what is grown in farms lead to excessive waste in food and resources to grow them.
